🧭 [Stock Dashboard](https://chengzuopeng.github.io/stock-dashboard/): A stock market dashboard demo built with stock-sdk. Feel free to try it.

## Why stock-sdk?

If you're a frontend engineer, you may have encountered these problems:

* Most stock market tools are in the **Python ecosystem**, making them hard to use directly in frontend
* You want to build a quote dashboard / demo without maintaining an extra backend service
* Financial APIs return messy formats with complex encoding (GBK / concurrency / batch)
* AkShare is powerful, but not suitable for browser or Node.js projects

**The goal of stock-sdk is simple:**

> Let frontend engineers elegantly fetch stock market data using familiar JavaScript / TypeScript.

---

## Use Cases

* 📊 Stock quote dashboards (Web / Admin)
* 📈 Data visualization (ECharts / TradingView)
* 🎓 Stock / finance course demos
* 🧪 Quantitative strategy prototyping (JS / Node)
* 🕒 Scheduled quote fetching via Node.js

## Features

- ✅ **Zero dependencies**, lightweight (< 20KB minified)
- ✅ Works in both **browser** and **Node.js 18+**
- ✅ Provides both **ESM** and **CommonJS** module formats
- ✅ Complete **TypeScript** type definitions and unit test coverage
- ✅ Real-time quotes for **A-shares, HK stocks, US stocks, mutual funds**
- ✅ **Historical K-line** (daily/weekly/monthly), **minute K-line** (1/5/15/30/60 minutes), and **today's timeline** data
- ✅ **Technical indicators**: Built-in MA, MACD, BOLL, KDJ, RSI, WR, BIAS, CCI, ATR and more
- ✅ Extended data such as **fund flow**, **large order ratio**
- ✅ Get full **A-share code list** (5000+ stocks) and batch fetch **whole-market quotes** (with built-in concurrency control)

## Installation

```bash
npm install stock-sdk
# or
yarn add stock-sdk
# or
pnpm add stock-sdk
```

## Quick Start (10-line Demo)

```ts
import { StockSDK } from 'stock-sdk';

const sdk = new StockSDK();

const quotes = await sdk.getSimpleQuotes([
  'sh000001',
  'sz000858',
  'sh600519',
]);

quotes.forEach(q => {
  console.log(`${q.name}: ${q.price} (${q.changePercent}%)`);
});
```

## Example: Whole-market A-share Quotes

Fetch the entire A-share market (5000+ stocks) directly from the frontend, with no Python or backend service.

```ts
const allQuotes = await sdk.getAllAShareQuotes({
  batchSize: 300,
  concurrency: 5,
  onProgress: (completed, total) => {
    console.log(`Progress: ${completed}/${total}`);
  },
});

console.log(`Fetched ${allQuotes.length} stocks`);
```
